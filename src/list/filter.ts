/**
 * `_$filter` is a type-level function that takes in two inputs:
 * a partially-applied type-level predicate that expects one more argument and returns a boolean type, 
 * and a target list of types upon which to perform the filtering operation.
 * It returns a filtered list of types.
 * 
 * The type-level function input must be a unary, curried `Kind` type as defined in this library.
 * @see {@link https://github.com/poteat/hkt-toolbelt/blob/main/docs/guides/custom-kinds.md} for details on how to create a custom kind.
 * 
 * @param F A type-level function that returns a boolean type indicating whether a type should be included in the result.
 * @param X A list of types. The target of the filtering operation.
 * 
 * @example
 * 
 * For example, we can use `_$filter` to filter out negative elements from a tuple of numeric types:
 * 
 * ```ts
 * import { List } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 * 
 * type FilteredNumbers = List._$filter<Conditional.IsPositive, [1, -2, 3, -4]>;  // [1, 3]
 * ```

 * @param F A type-level function that returns a boolean type indicating whether a type should be included in the result.
 * @param X A list of types. The target of the filtering operation.
 * 
 * @example
 * 
 * For example, we can define a filter for positive numbers and then apply it to a list:
 * 
 * ```ts
 * import { $, List, Conditional } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 * 
 * type FilteredNumbers = $<$<List.Filter, Conditional.IsPositive>, [1, -2, 3, -4]>;  // [1, 3]
 * ```
 * 
 * @example
 * 
 * We can also use the `$N` applicator to invoke `Filter` with a list containing the required arguments
 * This improves readability by allowing us to avoid nesting `$` calls. 
 * 
 * ```ts
 * import { $N, List } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 * 
 * type FilterZeros = $N<List.Filter, [
 *   $<Conditional.NotEquals, 0>,
 *   [1, 0, 2, 0, 3]
 * ]>;  // [1, 2, 3]
 * ```
 * 
 * @example
 * 
 * By partially applying only the first argument to `Filter`, 
 * we can define a type-level function that can apply the same operation to multiple list inputs.
 * 
 * ```ts
 * import { $, List, Conditional } from hkt-toolbelt;
 * 
 * type FilterZeros = $<List.Filter, $<Conditional.NotEquals, 0>>;
 * type AllZero = $<FilterZeros, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]>;  // []
 * type OneZero = $<FilterZeros, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]>;  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * ```
 * 
 * @example
 * 
 * Another use case for a partially-applied `Filter` function is to implement
 * sophisticated higher-order functionality by passing it into other type-level functions. 
 * 
 * ```ts
 * import { $, $$, List, Conditional, String } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 * 
 * type HelloWorld = $$<[
 *   $<List.Filter, $<Conditional.Extends, string>>
 *   $<String.Join, ", ">
 * ], [42.42, null, "hello", undefined, "world"]>  // "hello, world"
 * ```
