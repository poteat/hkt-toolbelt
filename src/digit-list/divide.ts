/**
 * `_$divide` is a type-level function that performs the division or modulo operation.
 * It takes in two digit lists `A` and `B` representing the dividend and divisor respectively, and an operation type
 * which can be either "DIVIDE" or "MODULO". It checks if the divisor is 0 or 1 and returns the appropriate result.
 * If the divisor is neither 0 nor 1, it calls the `_$divide2` function to perform the division.
 *
 * @param A A digit list representing a number to divide.
 * @param B A digit list representing a number to divide by.
 * @param OPERATION A string type representing the operation to be performed. Can be either "DIVIDE" or "MODULO".
 *
 * @example
 * For example, we can use `_$divide` to divide a digit list representing the number 10 by 2:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { DigitList } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 *
 * type Result = DigitList._$divide<["1", "0"], ["2"], "DIVIDE">; // ["5"]
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * We can also use `_$divide` to find the remainder when a digit list representing the number 123 is divided by 17:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { DigitList } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 *
 * type Result = DigitList._$divide<["1", "2", "3"], ["1", "7"], "MODULO">; // ["4"]
