/**
 * _$fixSequence is a type-level function that generates a fixed-point sequence
 * for a given kind `KIND`. A fixed-point sequence is a sequence of values where
 * the next value in the sequence is the result of applying `KIND` to the
 * previous value, and so on, until the value reaches a fixed point.
 *
 * A fixed point is reached when applying `KIND` to a value returns that same
 * value. Notably, this means that an infinite loop is possible if we do not
 * converge to a fixed point.
 *
 * There are two scenarios where we do not reach convergence:
 * - If we diverge (generate larger and larger values).
 * - If we oscillate (generate values that infinitely cycle between values).
 *
 * If convergence is not reached, the 'infinite type instantiation' error will
 * be emitted by the TypeScript compiler.
 *
 * ## Type Parameters
 *
 * - `KIND`: The kind for which the fixed-point sequence is generated.
 * - `VALUE`: The starting value of the fixed-point sequence.
 * - `STATE`: An array type that keeps track of the intermediate values in the
 * fixed-point sequence. This is optional and defaults to an array containing
 * the initial `VALUE`.
 *
 * ### Term Rewriting
 *
 * Here we show a simple example of a convergent fixed-point sequence. Term
 * rewriting is a concept in computer science that is used to transform a
 * string into another string.
 *
 * We define a term rule "xyz --> x", which replaces the string "xyz" with the
 * string "x". We then create a fixed-point sequence for this term rule.
 *
 * A term sequence may be terminal or non-terminal. A terminal term sequence is
 * one where we reach a state where no more term rules can be applied.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { $, Function, String, Combinator } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 *
 * // ["zyxyzyzyz", "zyxyzyz", "zyxyz", "zyx"]
 * type Rewrite = Combinator._$fixSequence<
 *   $<$<String.Replace, "xyz">, "x">,
 *   "zyxyzyzyz"
 * >
 * ```
 *
 * In the above example, we started with a given string and applied successive
 * term rules until we reached a terminal state.
 *
 * ### Divergent Case
 *
 * Here we show a simple example of a divergent fixed-point sequence. We define
 * the (+1) type-level function, which takes a number and returns that number
 * plus 1. We then create a fixed-point sequence for (+1), starting from the
 * value `0`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { $, Combinator, NaturalNumber } from "hkt-toolbelt";
 *
 * // Error: Type instantiation is excessively deep and possibly infinite.
 * type Result = Combinator._$fixSequence<
 *   $<NaturalNumber.Add, 1>>,
 *   0
 * >;
 * ```
