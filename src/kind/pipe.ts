/**
 * `_$pipe` is a type-level function that allows users to compose
 * multiple type-level functions together. It takes in a list of functions and a type argument as input,
 * composes the functions in its input list from left to right, and
 * and applies the resulting type-level function to the second input type.
 *
 * @template {Kind.Kind[]} FX - a tuple of type-level functions
 * @template X - a type to which a `Kind` can be applied
 *
 * @see {@link Kind._$compose}
 * The functionality of `_$pipe` is identical to `Kind._$compose`
 * except for the order of evaluation being reversed,
 * which has the advantage of improved readability.
 *
 * @see {@link $$}
 * In short, `$$` is an alias for `_$pipe`.
 * Refer to {@link $$} for examples.
 *
 * ## Errors
 *
 * `_$pipe` ensures that the tuple of kinds is composable by enforcing that
 * Nth type-level function's output is a subtype of the (N + 1)th input.
 * If this is not the case, `_$pipe` will return the `never` type.
 *
 * @see {@link Kind.InputOf} {@link Kind.OutputOf}
 * If you receive a `never` type, it can be helpful to use the `Kind.InputOf`
 * and `Kind.OutputOf` type-level functions to inspect the input and output
 * types of the type-level functions that you are piping together.
